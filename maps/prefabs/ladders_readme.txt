Making these takes time and effort!

The model can be ajusted for each prefab from the Object Properties panel. Collapsing the prefab is not necessary!
To unlock or lock ladder_larry or ladder_sliding using e.g. a button, just send an event to the prefab like any other entity.
The initial state of ladder_larry or ladder_sliding can be change in the object properties.
The ladder_plain can all be coloured in the object properties.

You can open the object propeties by clicking on an entity and pressing alt+Enter.
