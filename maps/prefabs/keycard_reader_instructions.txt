		6. Colour can now be seen and changed from the Map Variables tab.
	Multiple accepted keycards:
		Just duplicate the original keycard. Though any keycard with the same Name will work.

		On all keycard_filter_name entities change the Filter Name object propeties to name of keycard(s).
		You can use Map Variable for the name too.
